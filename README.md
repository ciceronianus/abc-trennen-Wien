Your Project
------------

This is a very simple project that consists of converting [Das Trenn-ABC – Müll richtig entsorgen](https://www.wien.gv.at/umwelt/ma48/beratung/muelltrennung/mistabc.html)
of the City of Vienna into a searchable table - this version is of W3.css (which I am learning).

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website. 

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ← script.js

If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
